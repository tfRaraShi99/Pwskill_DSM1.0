    "Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?Â \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Multiprocessing in Python is a module that allows the creation of multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space. This is useful for CPU-bound tasks as it enables true parallelism by utilizing multiple cores of a processor, unlike multithreading which is limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful because of:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **True Parallelism**: Allows for the execution of multiple processes simultaneously on multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Bypassing GIL**: Each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space, so it is not affected by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n",
    " \n",
    " * **Improved Performance**: Suitable for CPU-bound tasks that require significant computational power.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: A multiprocessing pool in Python is a collection of worker processes that can be used to execute functions in parallel. The multiprocessing.Pool class provides a convenient means of parallelizing the execution of a function across multiple input values, distributing the input data across processes (data parallelism).\n",
