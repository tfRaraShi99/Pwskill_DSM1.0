    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "(i)A Class is a collection of objects. It contains the blueprint or prototype from which objects are being created. Its a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods. It is defined using the keyword 'class' with a specific definition called as class body. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas,  Objects are entities that has a state and specific behaviour associated with it. It consist of :\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. State : It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.\n",
    "    2. Behaviour : It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.\n",
    "    3. Identity : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically when we define a class, it needs to create an object to allocate the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii)Following are the suitable examples for class and its objects. \n"

    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The Four Pillars of OOPs are :\n",
    "1. Inheritance : \n",
    "Inheritance is the most important aspect of object-oriented programming, which simulates the real-world concept of inheritance. It specifies that the child object acquires all the properties and behaviors of the parent object.It provides the re-usability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Polymorphism : \n",
    "Polymorphism contains two words \"poly\" and \"morphs\". Poly means many, and morph means shape. By polymorphism, we understand that one task can be performed in different ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encapsulation : \n",
    "Encapsulation is also an essential aspect of object-oriented programming. It is used to restrict access to methods and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Abstraction : \n",
    "Data abstraction and encapsulation both are often used as synonyms. Both are nearly synonyms because data abstraction is achieved through encapsulation.Abstraction is used to hide internal details and show only functionalities.\n"

    "(i)The __init__ function in Python is a special method also called as \"Constructor\", that is called automatically when one creates a new instance of a class. It is used to initialize the object's state. The task of constructors is to initialize (assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created.\n",
