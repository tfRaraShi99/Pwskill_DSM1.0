    "Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Multithreading in Python is a technique where multiple threads are created within a single process, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound operations, where threads can perform tasks such as reading from a disk, network operations, or user interactions simultaneously, thereby improving the efficiency of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used:\n",
    " * To improve the performance of I/O-bound operations.\n",
    " * To run multiple tasks concurrently.\n",
    " * To keep the application responsive (especially in applications).\n",

    "Ans: \n",
    "**run()**: The run() method defines the thread's activity and is the entry point for the thread. When a thread's start() method is called, the thread's run() method is invoked. It can be overridden in a subclass to define the thread's behavior.\n",

    " * **Concurrency**: Allows multiple operations to be performed simultaneously, leading to better resource utilization.\n",
    " * **Responsiveness**: Keeps the application responsive, especially in user interfaces.\n",
    " * **Resource Sharing**: Threads within the same process share memory and resources, which can be more efficient than using multiple processes.\n",
    " * **Economy**: Creating and managing threads requires less overhead compared to processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Complexity**: Writing multithreaded programs can be complex and error-prone.\n",
    " * **Synchronization Issues**: Threads may need to access shared resources, leading to potential issues like race conditions and deadlocks.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    " * **Deadlocks**:\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources. This typically happens when two or more threads acquire locks in different orders and end up waiting for each other.\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Race Conditions**:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing of events like thread execution order. This can lead to unpredictable results and bugs, especially when multiple threads access shared resources without proper synchronization."
