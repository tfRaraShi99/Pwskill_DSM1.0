    "Ans: Open function is used to open a file. The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    " * 'r' : (Read Only) opens the file for reading only. This is the default mode if no mode is specified. Raises an error if the file doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    " * 'r+': (Read and Write) opens the file for both reading and writing. This mode does not override the existing data, but you can modify the data starting from the beginning of the file. Thus file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    " * 'w' : (Write Only) opens the file for writing only. If the file exists, it truncates it to zero length. If it doesn't exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "     \n",
    " * 'w+': (Write and Read) opens the file for both reading and writing. If the file exists, it truncates it to zero length. If it doesn't exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    " * 'a' :(Append Only) opens the file for appending. It won’t override existing data. All data written to the file is added to the end. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    " * 'a+': (Append and Read) opens the file for both appending and reading. All data written to the file is added to the end. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    " * 'x' : (Exclusive Creation) opens a file for writing only, but only if the file does not already exist. If the file exists, it raises a FileExistsError.\n",
    "\n",
    " * 'b' : (Binary) opens a file in binary format, which is used for non-text files like images, audio, and video.\n",
    "\n",
    " * 't' : (Text) opens a file in text format (the default mode). It is used for reading and writing text files.\n",
    "\n",
    " * '+' : (Update) allows both reading and writing to the same file.\n",

This eliminates the need to manually close the file with the close() method, even if errors occur. The with statement improves code readability and resource management, and is considered a good practice.\n",

    " * Automatic file closure: The file closes automatically after the code block within the with statement is executed, even if exceptions occur.\n",
    " * Simplified code : The with statement replaces commonly used try/finally error-handling statements, simplifying the code.\n",
    " * Resource leak prevention: Guarantees that resources are released, which is crucial for preventing resource leaks that can crash or slow down the system.\n",
    " * Clean syntax : Provides cleaner syntax and exception handling.\n",
    " * Multiple file handling : Allows opening multiple files simultaneously within a single with statement. "
