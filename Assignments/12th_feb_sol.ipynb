    "\n",
    "Custom Exceptions are helpful in many ways. \n",
    " * Readability and Maintainability: Custom exceptions make the code more readable by providing descriptive names for specific error scenarios. This helps in understanding the purpose of error handling blocks and makes it easier to maintain the codebase.\n",
    " * Granularity: They allows one to handle different error situations differently. Instead of relying on generic exceptions like ValueError or IndexError, one can create custom exceptions for specific cases, enabling more precise error handling logic.\n",
    " * Debugging: Custom exceptions can include additional information about the error, such as specific values or context, making it easier to debug and pinpoint the source of the problem.\n"
